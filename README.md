# Activity Tracker

Activity Tracker is a Cloudless software usage tracker.

- Cloudless: Do we need to share personal data and habits with unknown services? Keep your data on your computer

- Tracker: Do you need to keep track of your time automatically? for projects, for works or simply "how many time have you spent on social networks today, is it necessary?"

## Why this project?

Life is a empty jar, you can feel it with Rocks (very important things... family, friends, life goals, etc.), Pebbles ( job, house, etc. ) and Sand ( things that are remaining small things), if you fill the jar with a time wasting sand, there will be no space for Rocks and Pebbles.
